Modern Refuge has carved out a unique space in the vibrant music scene of Connecticut and has quickly become one of the most exciting, must-see live acts around. The four-piece band cleverly combines folk warmth with psych-rock sprawl. They are known for their tightly wound indie grooves that rise into orchestral build-ups, harking back to the high-energy acts of the 70s.
They have opened for international touring acts including Sammy Hagar and The Circle, George Thorogood & The Destroyers, Talk, and Rozzi.
Modern Refuge are putting the final touches on their debut full-length studio album, set for release in early 2025. Generating a groundswell through their cathartic, raw live performances and across streaming platforms, recent singles like Velvet Gulch, Wave Empire, and Rope are laying the foundation for what’s to come. The songs were recorded and produced by Tom Pisani at Vibe Vault Studios (Old Saybrook, CT), Welcome to 1979 (Nashville, TN), and Power Station New England (Waterford, CT).
