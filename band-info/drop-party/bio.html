Led by choice horn melodies built on boisterous grooves, and launching off of hypnotic dance rhythms, Drop Party is a genre-bending, American, 8-piece band seamlessly carved out of the coastal Connecticut post-ska scene, endowed with new age funk, apt to get the crowd moving. This octet truly comes to life in their live performances – incorporating themed shows ripe with hidden Easter eggs, and scattered with seamless transitions and engaging moments.

Having cut their teeth at The Acoustic in Bridgeport, The Warehouse in Fairfield, CT, and several other select legendary local spots, Drop Party was forged right out of early 2000’s show bills that were all ages, no alcohol, and a less than functional sound system. At their shows, they have found a way to fuse and channel the stank of funk and sophistication of jazz into something far more palatable.
