Big Shrimp, the young and hungry quartet out of Bridgeport, CT—features Jared Sage Cowen (Guitar/Vocals), Max Perrotti (Bass/Vocals), Henry Thomas (Drums/Vocals), and Daniel Cohen (Keys/Vocals). Formed in 2024, the band blends masterful, high-energy musicianship with well-crafted, diverse songwriting, already making a major splash in the modern funk and indie rock scene.

They ambitiously launched their journey together by hosting a two-night festival in Upstate NY, followed by a hometown residency titled “The Black Rock Special”—a six-show, donation-based series, each performance themed around different musical and culinary shrimp specials, with proceeds benefiting various Connecticut charities.

Big Shrimp’s growing catalog reflects contributions from all four members, earning praise for its accessibility and stylistic range. Their material has landed on Spotify’s Modern Jam Band editorial playlist, a testament to the buzz.

“Cowen would dig even deeper into his bag of tricks for an extraordinary rendition of ‘Ordinary Guy,’ yielding some of the funkiest, most cathartic and most primal energy of the set. With catchy melodies, impressive solos, complex arrangements, and shifting tempos and moods, the band kept you on your toes and bobbing your head the entire show.” – NYSMusic

In Spring and Summer 2025, Big Shrimp embarked on tour, supporting acts like Spafford, Eggy, and Big Something, while also making festival appearances at Northlands Festival in New Hampshire alongside The String Cheese Incident, Corey Wong, moe., and Umphrey’s McGee. They were tapped to headline the festival’s official pre-party at Park City Music Hall, with a guest appearance by Tim Palmieri of Lotus. The band over the past year has also featured sit-ins from members of TAUK, co-billed with Dizgo at Brooklyn Bowl, and packed a sold-out Goose after-party in New Haven.

Big Shrimp will return to the road this Fall, expanding into new markets and revisiting familiar ones, with two major releases on the way: their debut studio album and the next volume of their live series, The Prawno Tapes, both set for release before the end of the year.
