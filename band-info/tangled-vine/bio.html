From <strong>Fairfield Living</strong>:<br>
&ldquo;OK, fine, so you didn't snag the Bruno Mars tickets that your bestie offered you.  And you will forever regret not catching Prince or The Rolling Stones in concert when you had a chance (yeah, bad call).  But that's OK, because Fairfield County Best Of voters are huge fans of Tangled Vine.  This group of musicians rock out to the most popular songs that will get you dancing, swaying, fist pumpin' and forgetting all about the stress and regrets of concerts missed.&rdquo;
<br><br>
Made up of professional full time musicians, winner mulitple times since 2006 of the Best of the Gold Coast's Highest Award for total votes for all gold coast towns, Tangled Vine never fails to ignite a room to smokin' hot and rockin'.
