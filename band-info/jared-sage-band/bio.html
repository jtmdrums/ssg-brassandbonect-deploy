Jared Sage Cowen is a guitarist, songwriter, and bandleader based in Bridgeport, Connecticut, whose dynamic playing and prolific catalog have made him a rising voice in the modern jam and progressive rock scenes. Born in Oceanside, NY in 1998, Cowen began playing guitar at the age of four and quickly immersed himself in music, drawing inspiration from improvisational greats like Trey Anastasio and Jerry Garcia, jazz and fusion icons such as Pat Metheny, Django Reinhardt, and John Scofield, and modern innovators like Tim Palmieri and Jimmy Herring. By the time he graduated from SUNY Oneonta with a degree in Music Industry in 2019, Cowen had already written an extensive body of work and launched his first nationally touring act.

That band, Baked Shrimp (2017–2024), rose from Long Island barrooms to become a festival staple, performing over 400 shows across the United States and releasing five albums. The trio performed at festivals alongside legends like Willie Nelson, My Morning Jacket, and Tedeschi Trucks Band, opened directly for Phil Lesh & Friends, The Disco Biscuits, Twiddle, and Dopapod, and landed on Spotify’s “Modern Jam Bands” editorial playlist with Cowen-penned fan favorites like Can’t Cut the Mustard and Chop Suey.

Following Baked Shrimp’s hiatus in 2024, Cowen reemerged with two distinct projects. The first, Big Shrimp, is a Bridgeport-based quartet blending funk, indie rock, and progressive improvisation. In just one year, the band supported acts like Spafford, Eggy, and Big Something; played festival stages alongside The String Cheese Incident, Corey Wong, and Umphrey’s McGee; and co-billed sold-out shows at venues like Brooklyn Bowl. Their performances, praised for “catchy melodies, impressive solos, complex arrangements, and shifting moods” (NYSMusic), have also featured sit-ins from Tim Palmieri (Lotus/Kung Fu) and members of TAUK. Big Shrimp’s debut studio album and live release The Prawno Tapes, Vol. 1 are slated for release in late 2025.

In parallel, Cowen launched Jared Sage Band, an ever-evolving touring collective built around his songwriting and improvisational vision. Each show is performed with a rotating cast of all-star musicians—sometimes local, sometimes nationally recognized—ensuring no two nights are ever alike. The project has already featured members of Dogs in a Pile, Stop Light Observations, Isaac Hadden Organ Trio, Aqueous, and more, with standout appearances as Artist-at-Large at Ohio DreamFest (2024) and Germination Festival (2025). This flexible approach reflects Cowen’s belief that improvisation thrives when musicians are pushed to connect instantly and creatively.

As a solo artist, Cowen has released three studio albums, most recently Vexatiously Gracious (2025), which was spotlighted on podcasts like All That Jam and All Jammed Up. Combined with his group efforts, he has now written and recorded over 200 original songs, while continuing to refine his voice as one of the jam scene’s most versatile guitarists—equally adept at fiery solos, lush harmonic textures, and lyrical melodic lines.

​Beyond his larger touring projects, Cowen also maintains a thriving solo acoustic looping show, where he builds layered soundscapes in real time with guitar, vocals, and effects. When not on the road, he can often be found performing these intimate sets at Connecticut breweries, wineries, restaurants, and local venues—bringing his blend of technical skill and improvisational creativity to audiences in a more personal setting.

​Outside of performing, Cowen is the founder of Sage Entertainment, a Bridgeport-based hub for artist development, event production, and live music strategy. With firsthand experience both on the road and behind the scenes, he works with artists, venues, and festivals on booking, branding, marketing, and creative direction. His work includes producing signature events like Big Shrimp’s Halloween Extravaganza, curating the Black Rock Special residency, and founding LonCon, a multi-day festival that doubled as both a fan celebration and artist retreat. In 2025, Cowen also took on the role of Marketing Director with Westcott Presents, collaborating on shows for nationally touring acts including The Disco Biscuits, Lettuce, and Pigeons Playing Ping Pong.

Whether leading Big Shrimp, curating the ever-shifting Jared Sage Band, running Sage Entertainment, or stepping on stage as a guest with artists like Al Schnier (moe.), Tim Palmieri, or members of Goose and Aqueous, Jared Sage Cowen has established himself as both a relentless creator and a true “artist-at-large.” With new music and national touring on the horizon, he continues to push forward as one of his generation’s most ambitious and collaborative guitarists.
